# SLURP

Sinatra Like URL Route Processing (SLURP) is another route framework to define REST API Ã  la Sinatra. SLURP is strongly typed  and modular. It is not bound to a server definition so that anyone can use it in existing projects and new ones with custom servers (Cohttp, H2, Apache, Nginx or whatever).

# Installation

SLURP isn't published to opam yet. Simply clone the repository and install it manually:
    
    git clone https://github.com/Ninjapouet/slurp.git
    cd slurp
    opam install .

# Documentation
